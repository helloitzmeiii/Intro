Hola/hello everyone! As you can see by the title, this is my intro. So to start all this off, I am a fan of Squid Game, and Sae-Byeok is my most favorite! I really love the color blue, although it was purple before, I sticked with the color blue as my favorite. Playing games are my favroite, or just color on an app on my device. I do have different types of food, but ice cream is my favorite. What are my favroite games/apps? Well Roblox, and Gacha life of course! But the funny thing is that, I don't play those very often now LOL.
Anyway the into is finished lol. Goodbye everyone, and remember to always stay awesome!
